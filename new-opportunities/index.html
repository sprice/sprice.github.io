    <h1>Let&rsquo;s Talk</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>More about me</h2>
      <p>I have over a decade of experience in both front-end and back-end web development. I currently enjoy using Javascript including ES6, React, Vue, Node, and Mongo.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 2017 I began learning Solidity and have enjoyed building smart contracts with Ethereum. A new programming paradigm, Solidity requires discipline, careful thought, and incredible prudence.</p>
      <p>I believe agile teams are more efficient and accountable teams. I am a certified scrum professional (CSP). While not dogmatic in my approach to applying agile principles I do know it means more than a morning standup.</p>
      <p>I have experience guiding teams through agile transformations leading to measurable improvement.</p>

      <h2>Opportunities I&rsquo;m looking for</h2>
      <p>I partner with tech companies building impactful products. I believe products can create a more even distribution of the experiences among all peoples lives. This often means working with early to min-stage startups. And these days it often means working with Blockchain companies.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve participated in the Blockchain space since early 2013. Since then it&rsquo;s become clear that decentralized and trustless systems will enable large amounts of positive change.</p>
      <h2>Some of my personal projects</h2>
      <p>I create web apps for personal enjoyment and to keep myself fluent with current and emerging technologies.</p>
      <p>Please note that I created each of these products to solve a problem, learn, and make something that works &ndash; as supposed to creating something that looks pretty.</p>
      <h3>Access Token</h3>
      <p>This was my final project for the <a href="https://consensys.net/academy/2018developer/">2018 ConsenSys Academy Developer Program.</a></p>
      <p>Access Token is an ERC-721 token that grants tiered access to any type of content. It could be modified for use of online newspaper paywalls using micropayments. Or for access to a library of video learning materials.</p>

      <h3>KittyCast</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">CryptoKitties</a> is the worlds first and most popular blockchain game. <a href="https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_2015">Chromecast</a> is the best way to watch content on your TV.</p>
      <p>The purrfect marriage of these two technologies is KittyCast. Cast your kitties to your TV, sit back, and enjoy.</p>

      <h3>Chill</h3>
      <p>This was my first exploration of Ethereum Smart Contracts and Solidity. Chill is a prototype of an online marketplace for digital art. Launched on the Rinkeby network in October 2017, Chill was an example of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) before NFTs were a thing.</p>

      <h3>Ringer</h3>
      <p>Ringer is a consumer SaaS app I built for myself. I was unhappy paying about CA $75/month for my mobile plan. Especially when realizing that most of that cost went towards rarely used voice and text. I built Ringer and switched to a data-only plan.</p>
      <p>Ringer is ideal for people who rarely take calls to their phone. It&rsquo;s a voicemail answering service &ndash; emailing a recording and transcription of the voicemail.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m someone who uses WhatsApp for nearly all my messaging and Google Dialer to place calls. Ringer allowed me to save about 60% on my monthly mobile plan.</p>
      <p>Now with a handful of paying customers and growing slowly, Ringer continues to be improved upon.</p>
